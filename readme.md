# Polaron

Polaron is a DIY digital drum machine based on the [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) USB Microcontroller plattform.

Main features:

- 16 step sequencer
- 6 instrument tracks
- 16 patterns per track
- load/save projects to SD card
- 2 pots for parameter control
- parameter locks: all instrument parameters can be recorded for each step
- different pattern length for each instrument track
- sync to midi-clock (usb-midi) or trigger input
- crunchy 12bit stereo outputs
- open source hardware/software: if you miss a feature or are annoyed by a bug... change it!

Disclaimer: This is a DIY project, features may change or not work for you. Use at your own risk.

## Known Issues:
PCB Rev 1.4

- In some situations, when connecting the polaron to a computer via usb and connecting the polaron audio output to an audio interface that is connected to the computer (e.g via thunderbolt), a ground loop is created. This results in a very noticable noise/whine in the audio channel (which is caused by the LED PWM). Tested solution: [Audio Ground Loop Noise Isolator](https://www.pjrc.com/store/audio_ground_isolator.html)

## FAQ

- Q: Is this an easy build? A: This is an intermediate project to build. Its not very complicated, but there are some SMD parts which are not easy to get right (the LEDs). You'll need a decent soldering iron, with a rather fine tip.
- Q: Is this a pro audio project? A: No, not exactly. The Polaron is more about a fun workflow than super hifi sound.
- Q: Does it work with a Teensy 3.5? A: PJRC forum member drjohn reports successfully running the Polaron with a Teensy 3.5.
- Q: Does it work with a Teensy 4.0 / 4.1? A: No, the Polaron relies on the internal DAC of the Teensy 3.6 and is not compatible with Teensy 4.0 / 4.1 - **Update: this version includes (so far) untested support for Teensy 4.1 using PT8211 audio output.**  It should work on Teensy 4.1 if a [PT8211 kit](https://www.pjrc.com/store/pt8211_kit.html) is soldered on top of Teensy 4.1.  The PT8211 kit gets digital audio from Teensy 4.1 pins 7, 20, 21 which are unused by other Polaron code.
- Q: Is there a manual? A: Yes, please check the [Project WIKI](https://github.com/zueblin/Polaron/wiki) for build instructions and operating manual. If you still have questions / suggestions, please send me a mail.
- Q: Does the polaron fit into a euro-rack? A: No, not really (PCB size is 15.7cm x 11.6cm). Polaron builder N.Shaver has experimented with a 3D printable eurorack case for the polaron which he shares on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3830556)
- Q: Can i buy a PCB? A: Sold out, but let me know if you'd be interested in buying one. ~~Yes, i currently have PCBs at 15 USD (+ shipping from switzerland). Please contact me by email, if interested.~~
- Q: Can i buy a part-kit? A: I don't sell part kits anymore, since it is very easy and efficient to order parts online, eg. from mouser. ~~Yes, i currently have part kits (PCB + all parts, EXCLUDING the teensy itself) at 60 USD incl. untracked international shipping. Add 5 USD for tracked shipping. Please send me a mail, if interested.~~
- Q: Can i buy a fully assembled Polaron? A: Not, not at the moment.
- Q: How can i support this project? A: Spread the word, star the project on github, let your friends know, buy a PCB, build a Polaron and share a video...there are many ways. In general, knowing that this project sparks some interest is what keeps it going!
